			<h1>1. I Have Experience.</h1>

			<p>For the past two years, I have been the treasurer for the Class of 2021. Over this time, I have spent many hours organizing school events, planning Olympics, putting together fundraisers, and more. With this experience, I know the responsibilities that a class officer takes on, and I believe that I would be able to tackle them.</p>

			<h1>2. I Am Organized.</h1>

			<p>A class secretary must be very organized. Whether it is notes from a meeting, or flyers for an upcoming event, the secretary must be able to keep track of documents. I believe that my experience as treasurer, including calculating detailed financial records, has taught me this skill.</p>

			<h1>3. I Am Responsive.</h1>

			<p>Whether it is a text, a Facebook message, or even a Snapchat, I always respond to questions, suggestions, or any other comments that classmates have. I believe that it is crucial that students can count on being heard and answered, which is why I make sure to answer any message in a timely fashion. </p>
